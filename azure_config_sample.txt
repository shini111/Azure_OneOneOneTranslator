ENDPOINT=https://your-deployment-name.services.ai.azure.com/models
API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-from-azure-ai-studio

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to "azure_config.txt"
# 2. Replace "your-deployment-name" with your actual Azure AI Studio deployment name
# 3. Replace "your-actual-api-key-from-azure-ai-studio" with your real API key
# 4. Save the file - it will be ignored by git for security
# 5. NEVER commit the real azure_config.txt file to GitHub!

# How to get these values:
# 1. Go to Azure AI Studio: https://ai.azure.com
# 2. Navigate to your DeepSeek deployment
# 3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint" section
# 4. Copy the endpoint URL and one of the API keys
# 5. Paste them above

# Example format:
# ENDPOINT=https://serviceName.services.ai.azure.com/models
# API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
          
# Security Notes:
# - Keep your API key secret and secure
# - Don't share it in public repositories
# - Rotate your keys regularly
# - Monitor usage in Azure portal
